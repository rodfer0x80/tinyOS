To boot we need a binary 512 bytes size file
ending in x0x55 0xaa
The rest of the code simply loops in order to fill
the remaining bytes
$ is current memory address
$$ is current section address
db is define byte
so we remove the size of the loop code
TODO: not sure we need the jmp $ but will test it out later
from 510 which is 512 - the 2 bytes from the end that we need to boot
